# tracking-service
a Service for trancking API usage of a dummy IP to location lookup service

# Question 4
  Your company has decided to sell its API for IP to location lookup as a service. However, there is currently no means to track usage by customers and to charge appropriate fees. Build a billing service that your company can use to track usage of itâ€™s APIs and prepare a monthly bill for customers. The location IP to location look up already exists and you are not required to build it, your job is to track API usage for billing.
